A heart that's full up like a landfill 
A job that slowly kills you 
bruises that won't heal

You look so tired, unhappy 
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us

I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide 
No alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises 
no alarms and no surprises
please
